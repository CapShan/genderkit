Laser eye surgery can be used to treat:

- *myopia* - shortsightedness or inability to clearly see things in the distance
- *hyperopia* - longsightedness or inability to clearly see things which are close up
- *astigmatism* - a condition where the eye does not focus evenly

There are two main types of laser eye surgery:

- *Photoreactive keratectomy (PRK)* or *Laser-assisted sub-epithelial keratectomy (LASEK)* - where a laser is used to vaporise tiny amounts of the cornea (lens of the eye) to reshape it. A computer watches the movements of the eye and reaims the laser to adjust for movement.
- *Laser-assisted in-situ keratomileusis (LASIK)* - which works in a similar fashion, but before reshaping the cornea, the eye is held in place by a suction ring and a laser is used to cut a flap into the epithelium (thin layer covering the cornea), and the flap is repositioned afterwards. LASIK may sometimes require less recovery time than PRK/LASEK.

Laser eye surgery is an area with continual development of new techniques, so you are advised to do your own research into the different kinds of eye surgery available to you.
