          <p>Hair patterning may also be known as Highlights, Lowlights, or Dip dye.</p>

        </ul>
        
          <p>The effects of the dyes in hair patterning may fade over time but will continue to have an effect until the hair grows out.</p>
        
        <h3>More information</h3>
        
<div class="warning">
  <div class="header">⚠ Warning</div>
  <div>
<p>The chemicals involved in hair colouring may cause an allergic reaction. It is very important to always perform a patch test first by using the chemicals on a small area 48 hours before applying it to the rest of your hair.</p>
</div>
</div>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em>Highlights</em> are when sections of the hair are lightened in colour, and lowlights are when articular sections of the hair are darkened.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Dip dye</em> is a style where only the ends of the hair are coloured</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Ombre</em> is a style where hair near the top of the head is left darker, while hair at the bottom is lighter.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As with other hair colouring, hair patterning techniques use a lightening step called “developer” (usually hydrogen peroxide based), followed by one of a variety of dyes. Depending on the type of dye (in particular, the molecular weight), the dye penetrates the hair differing amounts. Dye that penetrates further will result in a longer lasting effect - from lasting a few washes to until the hair grows out.</p>

<p>However, hair patterning is performed on only sections of the hair. This is most often done by using strips of foil to seperate the hair into sections. Other methods include using a cap which only certain strands of hair have been pulled through, or carefully painting colour onto certain sections with a brush (“balayage”).</p>

<p>Hair patterning will typically cost £xx-xxx.</p>
