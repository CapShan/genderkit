Gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists are medicines that cause the gonads (testes and/or ovaries) to stop producing sex hormones after a few weeks, and with continued use cause a sustained supression of sex hormone production.

Commonly used GnRH agonists in the UK are Goserelin (Zoladex), Triptorelin (Decapeptyl) and Leuprorelin (Prostap).

In people with testes, this produces an anti-androgenic effect (reduction in testosterone levels). GnRH agonists are more expensive than other antiandrogens, but often have less side effects, so are the common used antiandrogen in the UK {% cite seal:2007 --location 170 %}.

In people with ovaries, this reduces oestrogen and progesterone levels. This can cause periods to stop.

These medications are usually supplied in forms that are administered once every four weeks {% cite prostap %}, twelve weeks {% cite zoladex %}, or six months {% cite decapeptyl %}. 

GnRH treatment is available to people with testes who have a [formal diagnosis]({% link _articles/formal-diagnosis.md %}) of gender dysphoria for free on the NHS. It is also used by the NHS to prevent puberty in under 18s.
