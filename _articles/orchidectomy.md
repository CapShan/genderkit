{% capture warn %}
Orchidectomy results in permanent destruction of the testes and is irreversible. After orchidectomy you will be infertile and unable to have children unless you have previously carried out [gamete storage]({% link _articles/gamete-storage.md %}) (i.e. sperm banking).

In this surgery, the scrotum is cut open in the middle. The testes and the spermatic chords leading to the testes are removed through this incision. Afterward, the incision is sutured closed. This removes the main source of testosterone in the body.

Orchidectomy, like other gender surgeries, will normally require two opinions from gender specialists (such as NHS Gender Identity Clinic staff or private specialists) who have assessed you for suitability for surgery. Orchidectomy may not be suitable for people who are interested in later obtaining a vaginoplasty as it can make this more difficult - check with your surgeon if you are unsure. 

The cost of privately obtaining an orchidectomy in the UK is around Â£xxxx.

If you have a formal diagnosis of gender dysphoria, the NHS will usually provide funding for an orchidectomy.
