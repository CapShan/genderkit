{% capture warn %}
Phalloplasty is a complex surgical procedure with signficant risks that you must understand before it is carried out. Phalloplasty usually causes significant scarring due to skin grafting (usually on the lower arm). Complications are also common in this operation, particularly problems with urinating which may require surgical correction, including urethral strictures and fistulae (urethra closing up so you cannot urinate) {% cite frey2017update --location 732 %}.

Phalloplasty is surgery to create a penis, usually with the ability to urinate out of the end of it, and to make it erect. Often [scrotoplasty]({% link _articles/scrotoplasty.md %}) is performed at the same time.

An alterative option to phalloplasty is [metoidioplasty]({% link _articles/metoidioplasty.md %}). Phalloplasty usually creates an average sized penis, compared to the much smaller (5-7cm length) results of metoidioplasty. However, as metiodioplasty uses only clitoral tissue, it will usually provide an organ with good erogenous sensation which can become erect without the use of prostheses. Metoidioplasty also often requires only one surgery (compared to a series of surgeries for phalloplasty), less time in hopsital, and less scarring. Phallopasty patients will usually receive erectile prosthetics that allow the penis to become erect instead. This is usually inflated by a pump, often hidden inside one of the testicular prostheses which is squeezed to inflate the penis inplants.

Phalloplasty reqires reuse of skin from some other part of the body, most commonly the forearm. This skin is removed and used to create a tube that is reconnected to veins and nerves in the desired location. The arm then normally receives skin grafts to replace the removed skin, but there will be significant scarring on the arm {% cite frey2017update %}.
