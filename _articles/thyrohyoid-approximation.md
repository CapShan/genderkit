[Speech therapy]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/speech-therapy.md %}) is able to allow the majority of people to raise the pitch and change the qualities of their voice.

However, in a minority of the cases, this is not the case, and surgery can be carried out, though it requires subsequent additional speech therapy afterwards {% cite seal:2007 --location 194 %}.
