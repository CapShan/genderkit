{% capture warn %}
Some anti-androgens can cause permanent liver damage.  Prolonged anti-androgen
treatment can cause infertility, erectile dysfunction and genital shrinkage.
Taking anti-androgens without also taking another sex hormone (e.g.
[oestrogen]({% link oestrogen.md %}) or [testosterone]({% link testosterone.md %})
can cause osteoporosis.

Several different types of drug are used as anti-androgens:

- Goserelin (Zoladex), Triptorelin (Decapeptyl) and Leuprorelin (Prostap) are known as GnRH (gonadotropin releasing hormone) agonists. These medications cause the body to stop producing testosterone after a few weeks, and with continued use cause a sustained supression of testosterone production. These medications are usually supplied in forms that are administered once every four or twelve weeks. GnRH agonists are more expensive than other antiandrogens, but often have less side effects, so are the most frequently used antiandrogen in the UK.

- Spironolactone (Aldactone) is a commonly used antiandrogen in the US. It is much cheaper to obtain than GnRH agonists, but can often have side effects and after prolonged use may cause liver damage.

- Cyproterone acetate (Androcur) is a drug that reduces the amount that the body reacts to testosterone.

Anti-androgen treatment is available to people with a [formal diagnosis]({% link formal-diagnosis.md %}) of gender dysphoria for free on the NHS.
