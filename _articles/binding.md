Binders cannot be bought in high street shops and have to be ordered online. There are very few UK stockists but you may be able to find some on Amazon and eBay. Buying from abroad may incur customs charges.

Binders typically cost Â£25-50. There are several places to get them but the main ones are:
- [F2mbinders](http://www.f2mbinders.com/) - formerly known as Underworks
- [gc2b](https://www.gc2b.co/)
- [Les Love Boat](http://www.lesloveboat.com/shop/) - best for slim/small chested people
- [T Kingdom](http://www.t-kingdom.com/) - best for slim/small chested people

If you are unable to afford this, you may also be able to use: 
- the [MORF Binder Scheme](http://morfmanchester.blogspot.co.uk/p/binder-scheme.html), 
- in Northern Ireland the [Northern Ireland Binder Scheme](https://genderjam.org.uk/transresources/binders/), 
- or in Wales the [Trans*Form Cymru Binder Bank](http://youthcymru.org.uk/transform-cymru/binder-bank/) to obtain one. 

You may also be able to find other people in your area who are willing to donate a binder they no longer use.

You can get different styles of binders depending on where you get them from and your needs. Here are just a few:

- *Full length* binders are in a tank top style. The compression is mainly in the chest area but there is some in the stomach area too.
- *Tri top* binders are in a crop top style. The compression is in the chest area and the stomach area is left free.
