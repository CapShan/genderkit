{% capture warn %}
Cyproterone can cause liver malfunction and depression {% cite seal:2007 --location 170 %}. Prolonged anti-androgen treatment can cause infertility, erectile dysfunction and genital shrinkage. Taking anti-androgens without also taking another sex hormone (e.g. [oestrogen]({% link _articles/oestrogen.md %}) and/or [testosterone]({% link _articles/testosterone.md %}) can cause osteoporosis.

Cyproterone acetate (Androcur) is a drug that reduces the amount that the body reacts to testosterone.

In the UK GnRH (gonadotropin releasing hormone) agonists are generally prescribed instead, as they cause fewer side effects. These are described in more detail on the [GnRH agonists page]({% link _articles/gnrh-agonists.md %}).

In some cases, cyproterone is used in patients with testes receiving GnRH agonist treatment to reduce the effects of the initial spike in testosterone levels caused by these medications {% cite seal:2007 --location 170 %}.
