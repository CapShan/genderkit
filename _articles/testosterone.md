In a small proportion of people mensturation (periods) is not stopped by testosterone therapy, and either [GnRH agonists]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/gnrh-agonists.md %}) or [progesterone]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/progesterone.md %}) can be used to do this instead.

Testosterone therapy is not usually provided to under-18s, with the effects of hormones during puberty being stopped by [GnRH agonists]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/gnrh-agonists.md %}) until the age of 18 when testosterone therapy can be commenced.

Testosterone use can cause serious medical conditions including polycythaemia (too many red blood cells) and liver problems. For these reasons, regular blood tests are extremely important to prevent health problems. Testosterone also increases the risk of obstructive sleep apnoea (stopping breathing during sleep) which can lead to heart problems or sudden death.

Testosterone suppresses menstruation (periods), which can lead to endometrial hyperplasia, which increases risk of cancer. In the UK, it is recommended that people taking testosterone long-term undergo [hysterectomy]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/hysterectomy.md %}) to remove this risk {% cite seal:2007 --location 184 %}.
