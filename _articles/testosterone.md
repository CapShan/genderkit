In a small proportion of people mensturation (periods) is not stopped by testosterone therapy, and either [GnRH agonists]({% link _articles/gnrh-agonists.md %}) or [progesterone]({% link _articles/progesterone.md %}) can be used to do this instead.

Testosterone therapy is not usually provided to under-18s, with the effects of hormones during puberty being stopped by [GnRH agonists]({% link _articles/gnrh-agonists.md %}) until the age of 18 when testosterone therapy can be commenced.
