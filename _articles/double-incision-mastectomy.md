In double incision mastectomy, the breast tissue is removed, and usually the nipples are made smaller and repositioned.

Typically, mastectomy is performed using the double incision mastectomy technique. However, some people may be able to undergo [peri-areolar mastectomy]({% link _articles/peri-areolar-mastectomy.md %}) instead, which can result in less visible scarring {% cite seal:2007 --location 227 %}.
