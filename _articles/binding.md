Binders typically cost Â£25-50. If you are unable to afford this, you may also be able to use the MORF Binder Scheme (http://morfmanchester.blogspot.co.uk/p/binder-scheme.html), in Northern Ireland the Northern Ireland Binder Scheme (https://genderjam.org.uk/transresources/binders/), or in Wales the Trans*Form Cymru Binder Bank (http://youthcymru.org.uk/transform-cymru/binder-bank/) to obtain one. You may also be able to find other people in your area who are willing to donate a binder they no longer use.
