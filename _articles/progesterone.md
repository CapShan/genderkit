Progesterone (in particular, medroxyprogesterone or norethisterone) can be used to supress menstruation {% cite seal:2007 --location 182 %}. More recently, [GnRH agonists]({% link _articles/gnrh-agonists.md %}) have also been used for this purpose. (TODO: work out whether to cite Seal 2015 here or something else?)

Sometimes when [oestrogen]({% link _articles/oestrogen.md %}) is used, progesterone is also used, as some people have claimed that it affects breast size or shape. There is currently no clear evidence whether this is helpful {% cite wierckx2014clinical %}. Some endocrinologists have also suggested that use of progesterone may lead to an increased risk of breast cancer {% cite seal:2007 --location 174 %}.
