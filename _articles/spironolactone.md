{% capture warn %}
Spironolactone can cause permanent liver damage and should be taken under medical supervision where possible. Prolonged anti-androgen treatment can cause infertility, erectile dysfunction and genital shrinkage. Taking anti-androgens without also taking another sex hormone (e.g. [oestrogen]({% link _articles/oestrogen.md %}) and/or [testosterone]({% link _articles/testosterone.md %}) can cause osteoporosis.

Several different types of drug are used as anti-androgens. Spironolactone is a commonly used antiandrogen in the US. 

While spironolactone is much cheaper to obtain than GnRH agonists, it can often have side effects and after prolonged use may cause liver damage. In the UK endocrinologists usually prescribe GnRH (gonadotropin releasing hormone) agonists instead {% cite seal:2007 --location 170 %}. These medications are described in more detail on the [GnRH agonists page]({% link _articles/gnrh-agonists.md %}).
