{% capture warn %}
Some anti-androgens can cause permanent liver damage.  Prolonged anti-androgen
treatment can cause infertility, erectile dysfunction and genital shrinkage.
Taking anti-androgens without also taking another sex hormone (e.g.
[oestrogen]({% link oestrogen.md %}) or [testosterone]({% link testosterone.md %})
can cause osteoporosis.

{% include warning warning=warn %}

Anti-androgen treatment should be supervised by a medical professional. If this
is not possible, you should carry out regular blood tests to avoid dangerous
health complications. Anti-androgen treatment is available to people with a
[formal diagnosis]({% link formal-diagnosis.md %}) of gender dysphoria for free
on the NHS. Several medications are available which either reduce the effects of
testosterone (cyproterone) or reduce the body's production of testosterone
(other anti-androgens). These medications can reduce body hair growth and
thickness and reduce erections.
